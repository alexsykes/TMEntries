<p>Dear {{$user->name}},</p>
<p>I am writing to you as your email - {{$user->email}} - is registered as a user of the TrialMonster.uk website. A number of upgrades have recently been applied to the site which should improve its security and reliability.</p>
<p><b>How does this affect me? </b>Your login details - username, email address and password - have all been transferred to the new system so there is no need to register again although <b>you will need to change your password</b>.</p>
<p><b>Do I need to do anything now? </b>Only if you are wishing to enter a trial. Unregistered 'Guest' users are able to check out details of results and future trials without logging in. <b>If you wish to enter a trial, you will need to update your password</b>.</p>
<p><b>How do I update my password? </b>The simplest way to update your password is to request a <b>Password Reset</b> by clicking on this link - <a href="https://trialmonster.uk/forgot-password">https://trialmonster.uk/forgot-password</a>. Enter your registered email address, then click the Email Password Reset Link button which will send an email with a link to your email address. Once you receive that email, click on the Reset Password button and, when the page loads, enter your password. </p>
<p><b>I no longer wish to be registered with this site. How do I close my account?</b> Simply click on the following link - <a href="https://trialmonster.uk/close-my-account/{{$user->id}}/{{$user->email}}">https://trialmonster.uk/close-my-account</a> - and your account will be closed.</p>

<p>Thank you for using TrialMonster,<br>Alex - TrialMonster Developer</p>
